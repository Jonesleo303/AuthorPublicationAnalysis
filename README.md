# Author Publication Analysis

## Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to visualize publication patterns and trends of authors using pie and bar charts. Key objectives include:
- Visualizing the distribution of publications among authors.
- Highlighting the publication frequency of individual authors.
- Displaying the impact of authors based on publication data.

## Summary
This project provides visual insights into author publication data using basic chart types:
- **Pie Charts**: Used to show the distribution of publications among authors.
- **Bar Charts**: Used to illustrate the publication frequency and impact of individual authors.

## Technical Skills
- **Python**: Utilized for generating pie and bar charts.
- **Excel**: Used for initial data exploration and preparation.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered publication data, including authors and publication counts.
2. **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and formatted the data for visualization.
3. **Visualization**: Created pie and bar charts to represent publication data.

## Results
- **Pie Charts**: Visualized the proportion of publications contributed by different authors.
- **Bar Charts**: Illustrated the frequency of publications by individual authors and their impact.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for visualization.
- `scripts/`: Includes the Python scripts used for generating pie and bar charts.
- `results/`: Stores the visualizations created.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview and description of the project.

## Usage
To replicate the visualizations, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Jonesleo303/AuthorPublicationAnalysis.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd AuthorPublicationAnalysis
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install matplotlib pandas
    ```

4. **Run the visualization scripts**:
    Open and run the Python scripts in the `scripts/` directory using your preferred Python environment.

## Conclusion
This project provides simple yet effective visualizations of author publication data using pie and bar charts. These charts offer a clear view of publication distributions and frequencies among authors.
